<h3>Hello, I'm Karon and I created this site using the SSG, Jekyll. </h3>

<p>I enjoyed Jekyll a lot more than I enjoyed Harp. This could be because I experienced lots of issues with Harp, but putting that aside, I still think I would like Jekyll better. The process feels a little bit easier than Harp's. I would definitley use
    Jekyll again for an assignment or for creating a blog for someone. I think I will teach this to my nephew, he really likes to learn about coding and he is only 9 years old. I think that this is something that he can learn easily and use to help build
    some momentum for his learning! For me, using markdown has really made the process a lot faster than going in and updating the HTML directly. The _config.yml took me a minute to wrap my head around, but now I understand what it is doing and it also
    helps to speed up the process of making updates to the website/blog posts. </p>
