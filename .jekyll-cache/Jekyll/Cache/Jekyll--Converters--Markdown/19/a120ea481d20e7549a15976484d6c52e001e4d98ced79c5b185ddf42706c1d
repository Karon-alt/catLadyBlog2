I"N<p>Valentines Day is thought to have started in the Roman days with a festival. At the festival young men were coupled with a young woman for the duration of the festival. He would spank the woman with the hides that he had just slain as a sacrifice. Also, ancient Roman Emperior Claudius II executed two men-both anmed Valentine- on Feb. 14. These men were martyrd by the Catholic Church. With the help of William Shakespear the holiday grew a little sweeter. Handmade paper cards became tokens of love in the Middle Ages.   </p>

<p>Cats really have nothing to do with Valentine's Day. Peoply do love their cats and Valentine's Day is all about love. So, why not?

<h2 class="section-heading">Big Business</h2>

<p>Today the holiday is big business. Market research suggests that up to $18 billion dollars is spent on Valentine's Day. I think I prefer a handmade card instead of joining in on the consumer mad house.
