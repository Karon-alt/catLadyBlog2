I"<p>Valentines Day is thought to have started in the Roman days with a festival. At the festival young men were coupled with a young woman for the duration of the festival. He would spank the woman with the hides that he had just slain as a sacrifice. Also, ancient Roman Emperior Claudius II executed two men-both anmed Valentine- on Feb. 14. These men were martyrd by the Catholic Church. With the help of William Shakespear the holiday grew a little sweeter. Handmade paper cards became tokens of love in the Middle Ages.   </p>
