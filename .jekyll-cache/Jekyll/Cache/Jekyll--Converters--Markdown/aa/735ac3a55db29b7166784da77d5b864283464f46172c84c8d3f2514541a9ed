<p>There are over 500 million domestic cats in the wolrd. This makes cats one of the most popular pets in the world. </p>

<p>Cats conserve energy by sleeping 13-14 hours a day, and you thought they were just lazy! Cats and humans have been associated for over 10,000 years.

<p>There can be no question that training a pet can be full time job, but not if you have a cat. They do not do tricks, so do not bother trying to teach them. They do not need you to give them a bath, they will take care of that for you!

<blockquote class="blockquote">“Time spent with cats is never wasted.” – Sigmund Freud.</blockquote>

<p>Some folks believe cats are aliens that are sent here to spy on humans. If you've ever woke up to a cat giving you a stare down you may be inclined to believe this a little bit more!

<h2 class="section-heading">No Potty Training Necessary</h2>

<p>No puppy pads needed. One can simply set out a litter box and your little four legged genuis will know what to do. Show me a puppy that can do the same.
